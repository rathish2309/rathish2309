### 🧠 About Me  

I’m a QA Engineer with experience across **Web**, **API**, and **Mobile** test automation.  
I work with **Java-based automation frameworks** — using **Selenium with Cucumber**, **Appium with TestNG**, and **Rest Assured** for API testing.  
I also leverage **GitHub Copilot** to enhance automation efficiency and framework scalability.  

I’m currently expanding into **DevOps** and **Cloud**, working with tools like  
`Docker`, `Kubernetes`, and `Jenkins`, and exploring modern approaches to optimize continuous testing and integration.
